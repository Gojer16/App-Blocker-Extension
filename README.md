# App Blocker - Focus Through Friction

A Chrome extension built to eliminate digital distractions by blocking time-wasting websites and requiring the user to complete a focused typing challenge before gaining temporary access. Designed for people who want tighter discipline, less impulse browsing, and a cleaner mental environment.

## Overview

App Blocker interrupts autopilot browsing.
When you try to open a distracting site, you must complete a series of productivity-themed typing paragraphs—designed to slow you down, build intention, and reinforce your goals. Only after completing all challenges do you earn limited-time access.

## Features
